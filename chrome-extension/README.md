# AiDD Chrome Extension

## Overview

AiDD Chrome Extension is a comprehensive toolset designed to enhance AI-driven development (AiDD) workflows. It integrates seamlessly with Pivotal Tracker and Skydeck AI, bridging the gap between project management and AI-assisted development to boost productivity for development teams.

## Tools

The AiDD Chrome Extension includes the following tools:

1. **AiDD Prompt Generator**: Generates AI-driven development prompts based on Pivotal Tracker stories and selected project files.
2. **Auto Apply Code Changes**: Allows developers to directly apply code changes suggested by AI within Skydeck AI.
3. **File Selection Tool**: Enables quick file selection from any webpage using a customizable keyboard shortcut.

## Features

- **Pivotal Tracker Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Pivotal Tracker by adding an "AiDD Prompt" button to the story interface, enabling quick access to AI-driven development workflows.
- **Intelligent File Selection**: Allows users to choose relevant files and folders from their local project, respecting `.gitignore` rules.
- **Multiple Prompt Templates**: Supports creating and managing multiple prompt templates, with the ability to switch between them.
- **Customizable Prompt Templates**: Users can modify prompt templates to suit their specific needs and development practices.
- **Skydeck AI Integration**: Automatically pastes generated prompts into Skydeck AI and optionally submits them, saving time and reducing context-switching.
- **Preview Functionality**: Users can preview file contents before including them in the prompt.
- **Responsive UI**: Features a split-view interface with resizable panels for easy file selection and content preview.
- **File Selection Memory**: Remembers the last selected files for convenience in subsequent prompt generations.
- **File Search**: Quickly find and select specific files within your project structure.
- **Apply Changes**: Allows code changes to be applied directly within Skydeck AI.
- **Auto-fix Git Diff**: Automatically attempts to fix incorrect Git diffs generated by AI.
- **Global File Selection Shortcut**: Trigger the File Selection tool from any webpage using a customizable keyboard shortcut.
